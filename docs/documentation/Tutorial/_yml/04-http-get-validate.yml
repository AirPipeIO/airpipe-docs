description: Receive a GET and validate

interfaces:
  tutorial/validate: # <- if a route is not defined, the interface name will be the default route
    output: http # <- output as http, if no method is defined it is defaulted to GET
    # route: tutorial/customvalidate # if this was enabled, then the http route would be this, and not the interface name
    actions:
      - name: CheckParams
        input: a|params # we do not use a closing pipe here, as we want the input to access the data, and not replace the value here
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: id # look for the `id` value in query parameters
              is_not_null: true # ensure it exists else error
            - value: first # look for the `first` value in query parameters
              is_not_null: true # ensure it exists and the value is greater than 2 and less than 5

      - name: GetData
        depends_on: # we can now use `depends_on` to provide a list of actions to complete before running the GetData action
          - previous # `previous` is a special key word, we can use this to say do not run this action until the previous
        #  - CheckParams # we could remove `previous` and explicitly define the action name from the previous called `CheckParams`
