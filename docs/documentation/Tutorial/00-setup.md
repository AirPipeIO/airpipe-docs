    It is incredibly easy to also use the self hosted version on your machine as well, as such we do recommend to use this where possible.

    #### Why?
     - Additional capabilities such as running commands, scripts, using environment variables, persisting database connections, tracing etc.
     - Deploy however and wherever you like, docker, k8s, on host etc.
     - Better performance with it deployed in your own environment
     - Control your data and security end to end
     
     #### Install
    - Retrieve or generate an API Key in your account
