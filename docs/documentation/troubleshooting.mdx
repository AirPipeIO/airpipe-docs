# Troubleshooting

## Local Testing

Your configuration files should seamlessly work in the majority of cases on your local machine. As such this is generally the best way to test quickly.

### Detailed Logs
1. [Download or install](/docs/install) the binary to your local machine.
    - Using the local flag is recommended, else you can also use the download flag for just the binary.
2. Add your configuration files to your target directory, and run the binary locally.

    Given the below local structure: 
    ```
    ├── airpipe # <- binary
    ├── configs
    │   ├── my-test-config.yml
    │   └── mongo.yml
    ```

    Running the below command will run the configuration files from the target directory.
    ```sh
    ./airpipe --api-key enter-your-api-key --config-dir configs/
    ```

3. Review the current log output, or increase the log level.

    Log Levels: info, debug, warning, error, trace, critical
    ```sh
    ./airpipe --api-key enter-your-api-key --config-dir configs/ --log-level trace
    ```

4. Stop and Start the binary when you make changes to the configuration file to ensure there are no issues and you have fresh logs.


## API / HTTP Response

When building HTTP based configs for APIs, the API response provides information at each action you define. You can also hide this from the output if required.

Use your preferred HTTP testing tool or command whether that is postman, bruno or curl etc. and review the full response.

Each action also provides the time taken at each step, so you know where best to optimize.

If you need to handle errors and edge cases review [04 - Validating & Testing Data](/docs/tutorial/validating-data) and [asserts](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/asserts).

```json
{
  "data": {
    "CheckParams": {
      "data": {
        "first": "panther",
        "id": "1"
      },
      "errors": [
        "first::is_less_than: expected target panther not less than 5"
      ],
      "time.ms": 0
    },
    "GetData": {
      "data": null,
      "error": "previous action 'CheckParams' did not succeed",
      "time.ms": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom Logging

In your configuration files, you can use the `pre_log` and `post_log` features to either enhance your logs, or debug issues commonly to do with interpolation ([variable substitution](/docs/configuration/substitutions)) problems.

- `pre_log` can be used before your input has run
- `post_log` for after the input has run
- Supply an array of log messages with a `msg` and `level` parameters
- Messages are able to use [variable substitutions](/docs/configuration/substitutions) 

### Example
```yaml
      - name: CreateAsssistant
        pre_log:
          - msg: hello
            level: info
          - msg: hi there
            level: debug
        run_when_succeeded:
          - previous
        retry:
          attempts: 3
          delay: 1500
          exponential_backoff: true
        command:
          run: cat tests/payloads/nested-json.out
          parse:
            data_type: json
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: firstname
              is_equal_to: tom
              is_not_null: true
        post_log:
          - msg: some trace msg - a|CreateAsssistant::something| - a|CreateAsssistant::id|
            level: trace
          - msg: goodbye
            level: critical
```
