# Open Telemetry Tracing

Zero code automatic open telemetry tracing is supported when using the binary directly in self hosted mode.

This will enable you to get detailed tracing sent to your preferred observability solution.

We also support trace propagation in most cases with no further configuration required.

## How

Supply your OTEL endpoint and optionally authorization header as required via environment variables or the argument flags.

You can also supply specific headers such as `authorization` for authentication to your otel endpoint as needed by supplying environment variables in the following format:
`AIRPIPE_OTEL_HDR_<YOUR_HEADER_NAME>="<YOUR_HEADER_VALUE>"`

No further configuration is required.

### Environment variables
```
AIRPIPE_OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.1.52:5080/api/default" AIRPIPE_OTEL_HDR_AUTHORIZATION="Basic 123==" ./airpipe server --some-other-flags
```

### Arguments
```
AIRPIPE_OTEL_HDR_AUTHORIZATION="Basic 123==" ./airpipe server --otel-endpoint "http://192.168.1.52:5080/api/default" ./airpipe server 
```
