# Billing

We aim to offer simple transparent pricing.

As such we bill per `request unit` we define this as each time you trigger a configuration file with 1 second of execution time.

You are not charged for:
    - Bandwidth/egress/data charges.
    - How many actions your single configuration and interface may take.

### Scenarios
- Your configuration that validates data and connects to a database takes 500ms 
    - Billed: 1 request unit
- Your configuration that has many actions and connects to many endpoints takes 800ms 
    - Billed: 1 request unit
- Your configuration has 1 action, that collects and generates a large amount of data takes 4700ms
    - Billed: 5 request units

### Hosted (Managed) & Self-Hosted (Unmanaged) Request Units

If you are hosting your configuration file on our backend your managed request unit balance will be deducted.

If you are self hosting by using the binary directly in anyway eg. server, local machine etc. this will be deducted from the self-hosted/unmanaged balance.

You can view your respective balances and usage under `Billing > Usage`.
