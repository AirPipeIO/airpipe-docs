# Mac

### Retrieve API Key

Log in and retrieve an API key from https://app.airpipe.io/apikeys

### Permissions & Security

On new Apple devices, gatekeeper will block the binary from running by default.

After you attempt to run it once simply with `./airpipe` you will need to allow it by going to `Privacy & Security` scroll towards the bottom, and there will be a prompt to allow the binary.

### Download the binary to the current directory
```sh
  curl -s https://download.airpipe.io/setup.sh | sudo bash -s -- \
    --api-key enter-your-api-key-12345 \
    --download
```

### Download the binary to the current directory and generate directories
This is typically used in tutorial mode.
```sh
  curl -s https://download.airpipe.io/setup.sh | sudo bash -s -- \
    --api-key enter-your-api-key-12345 \
    --local
```
