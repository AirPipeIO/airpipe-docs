# Workflow Control

Are a way to control whether or not you want to run an action. 

### View complete examples [here](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/workflow-control/examples).


There are 4 key options:
 - run_when_succeeded
 - run_when_failed
 - run_when_finished` (alias `depends_on`)
 - run_on_assertion
---

For the first 3 options you can define this in one of two ways:

```yaml
run_when_succeeded: [previous, anotherAction]
```

```yaml
run_when_succeeded: 
  at_least: 1
  actions: [previous, anotherAction]
```
---
For `run_on_assertion` this uses uses the identical `assert` system used for validating actions, see [here](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/asserts).

```yaml
  - name: GetUser2
    run_when_finished: [GetUser1] # you should typically ensure the actions that run_on_assertion depends on are finished 
    run_on_assertion: #<---! this is used for asserting any of the prior actions before starting this one
      tests:
        - action: GetUser1
          value: .name
          is_equal_to: "Ervin Howell"
    http: 
      url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/2
      headers:
        content-type: application/json
    assert: # this is used for asserting the data you fetched from this action itself
      tests:
        - value: .body.name
          is_not_null: true
```
