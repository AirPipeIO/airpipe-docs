# Run Conditions

Are a way to control whether or not you want to run an action.

View complete examples [here](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/run-conditions/examples).

```yaml
run_condition:
  when_succeeded:
    actions: [previous, anotherAction]
```



## Run Condition

| Name                 | Type   | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `when_finished`      | object | if the defined actions have finished then proceed |
| `when_succeeded`     | object | if the defined actions have succeeded then proceed |
| `when_failed`        | object | if the defined actions have failed then proceed     |
| `assert`             | assert | use the [assertion system](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/asserts) to determine whether or not to run      |
