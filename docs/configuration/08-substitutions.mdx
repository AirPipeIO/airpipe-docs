# Variable Substitutions

Variable substitutions are used to dynamically inject data and modify your configuration.

## Usecases
    - Database input parameters
    - Using environment variables or secrets
    - Dynamically building URLs or payload structures

## How
To substitute variables the following convention is followed `a|<something>|`.
    - All substitutions must start with `a|` and end with a `|` 
    - You may notice in configs, `input: a|body`, `input: a|params`, `input: a|headers` these are **not** substitutions, they are for accessing data when used in the `input` parameter, as such they do not have a trailing `|`.
      - See [Input Variables](#input-variables) below on how to access values within the above mentioned.
    - Complicated substitutions such as `templates`, `HTML`, `JSON` etc. should use a literal scalar blocks eg.

    ```yml
    actions:
        name: send data
        http:
            url: http://endpoint123.com/someroute
            body: | # <- literal scalar block
                a|var::some_big_json| # assuming a variable called `some_big_json` is stored in the global variable store
    ```

## Input Variables
To substitute a value from one of the above mentioned properties into a config it would need to be for eg. `a|body::id|`, `a|params::id|` this specifies a parameter to access, followed by a trailing `|` pipe.

### Access a query parameter
  ```yml title="Access a query parameter"
  actions:
      name: doSomething
      http:
          url: http://endpoint123.com/someroute?id=a|params::id| 
          # ^^ access the value of `id` from the query parameters ^^
  ```

### Access a value from the input body
  ```yml title="Access a value from the input body"
  actions:
      name: doSomething
      http:
          url: http://endpoint123.com/someroute?id=a|body::id| 
          # ^^ access the value of `id` from the input body ^^
  ```

## Action Variables

 You can access data from prior actions with the following convention `a|ACTION_NAME::some_variable|`


We can access the `firstname` variable from the `CheckBody` action with `a|CheckBody::firstname|`, to supply as a parameter to our database query.
This assumes that the input data for the `CheckBody` action contains a variable called `firstname`.
```yaml title="Access the variable named 'firstname' from the CheckBody action"
    actions:
      - name: CheckBody
        input: a|body # <- NOT a variable substitution

      - name: CheckUser
        run_when_succeeded:
          - previous # wait for the previous action to complete
        database: main
        query: |
          SELECT firstname, lastname, address1 FROM customers WHERE firstname LIKE $1 LIMIT 2;
        params:
          - a|CheckBody::firstname| # <-- here
```

## Global Variables
See [`global variables`](/docs/configuration/globals/variables).

## Environment Variables (Self Hosted Only)
Substitute an environment variable called `MY_ENV` into your configuration yaml with:<br/>
```a|env::MY_ENV|``` 

 ```yaml title="Substitute an environment variable called 'ORG_ID' into the url of the http request"
    actions:
      - name: CheckBody
        http:
          url: https://some-endpoint.com/a|env::ORG_ID|/data/something
```
