# Configuration Files

Configuration files are built with **YAML** and follow a logical flow. 

They are the key component to building your workflows, APIs, integrations and anything else you can think off.

### Info
  - All actions are executed asynchronously by default, you can use features to control the flow of actions eg. `depends_on`
  - Avoid overlapping interface and route names to prevent unintended collisions/overlaps
  - You can have many interfaces with many actions in a single configuration
  - Some features such as input `commands` are for self hosted deployments only

### Structure

This is a high level view of the general structured and is non-exhaustive.
