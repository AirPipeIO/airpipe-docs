# Managed Variables & Secrets

The Air Pipe platform allows you to store common variables and encrypted variables or secrets to be used across your hosted and self-hosted configurations.

## Usecases
    - Common variables such as endpoint addresses eg. `https://commonThirdPartyService.com/api/`
    - Database connection strings ***(encrypted mode)***
    - Credentials ***(encrypted mode)***

## How

### Adding

1. Login to the platform -> https://app.airpipe.io
2. Select the appropriate organization
3. Click on `Variables` in the menu
4. Click `Add New`
    - Enter a name and description (it is recommended to avoid overlapping names)
    - The `Value` is the content of your variable
    - Only select `Encrypt` if you are storing a sensitive variable eg. secret
        - Note: as with all encryption related tasks they will carry a performance overhead when used during the access and decryption process
    - Select the appropriate permission
        - If you are using role based permissions note that the hosted `configuration` or `api key` being used must also have the matching role to access this variable


### Accessing
To substitute a managed variable the following convention is followed `a|ap_var::<NameOfTheVariable>|`.

- Assume we have stored a variable called `MyThirdPartyService` with the value off `https://something.com/api/`.
- This means we can access the variable with `a|ap_var::MyThirdPartyService|`
- We can place this for substitution in nearly any area of your configuration file
- If you have selected to `encrypt` the decryption process will be handled seamlessly for you

### Access a query parameter
  ```yml title="Access a query parameter"
  actions:
      name: doSomething
      http:
          url: a|ap_var::MyThirdPartyService|/someroute?id=a|params::id| 
          # ^^ access the value of `MyThirdPartyService` to build the complete url ^^
  ```
