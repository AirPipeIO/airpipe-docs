# Inputs

Inputs are a way to fetch or process data in each of your actions.
They can be incoming data, previous action data, or newly fetched data eg. database queries, http requests, commands, or even used for triggering emails and processing the response etc.

Each action accepts **one** input only.

You can either define in your action:
- `input: a|body`
- `input: a|headers`
- `input: a|params`
- `input: a|<action-name>`

Or alternatively, make a request to fetch data by defining one of the below options:
- [`command`](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/inputs/command)
- [`database`](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/inputs/databases)
- [`http`](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/inputs/http)
- [`email`](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/inputs/email)

> Note **inputs** do not have trailing `|` Pipes

```yml title="handling the input body from a http request"
name: input-tests

interfaces:
  inputs/example:
    output: http

    actions:
      - name: Inputs
        input: a|body
```


Alternatively to use the other available inputs,
define their required parameters as described in their corresponding documentation.

```yml title="fetching new data via the command functionality"
name: input-tests

interfaces:
  inputs/example:
    output: http

    actions:
      - name: ParseCsv
        command:
          run: cat payloads/heroes.csv
          parse:
            data_type: csv
```
