# 07 - Workflow Control

When defining your configuration, you also define a set of actions that can be controlled depending on your defined conditions.

In some of the prior examples you would have noticed these being used.

### Behaviour & Rules
 - Actions by default execute asynchronously.
    - This means if you have multiple actions defined under one interface with no controls they will all execute at the same time.
 - Actions can execute sequentially when using the appropriate workflow controls.
    - Actions do not necessarily need to be in the order they execute although it is recommended for a logical approach and that shortcuts can be used.
 - The action **`name`** should be unique so controls can be used appropriately.
 - Actions can be retried on failure.
 - Actions should only have one input, this could be defined with **`input: something`** or a via defining a particular functional input such as a database query or http request etc.

## depends_on

To control your actions to execute sequential, you can use the `depends_on` workflow control.

`depends_on` just requires the defined list of actions to complete whether success or failure.

### Basic Example

```yml
name: Tutorial - depends_on - 1
description: Workflow control

  tutorial/workflow-depends-on:
    output: http
    method: POST

    actions:
      - name: CheckLoginBody
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: email
              is_not_null: true

      - name: CheckSomeOtherData
        depends_on:
          - CheckLoginBody # wait for this action to finish before continuing
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true
```

### Example with `previous` shortcut

The `previous` keyword to refer to the previous action for the same behaviour

```yml
name: Tutorial - depends_on - 2
description: Workflow control

interfaces:
  tutorial/workflow-depends-on-2:
    output: http
    method: POST

    actions:
      - name: CheckLoginBody
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: email
              is_not_null: true

      - name: CheckSomeOtherData
        depends_on:
          - previous # we can use the `previous` keyword to refer to the previous action for the same behaviour
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true
```

### Depending on multiple actions

In this example the first and second action `CheckLoginBody` and `CheckParams` will run asynchronously, however the third action will wait on these two before running.

```yml
name: Tutorial - depends_on - 3
description: Workflow control

interfaces:
  tutorial/workflow-depends-on-3:
    output: http
    method: POST

    actions:
      - name: CheckLoginBody
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: email
              is_not_null: true

     - name: CheckParams
        input: a|params
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true

      - name: CheckSomeOtherData
        depends_on:
          - CheckLoginBody # we can define a list of actions here to wait on
          - CheckParams
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true
```

## run_when_succeeded

Run this action when the list of defined actions under `run_when_succeeded` has completed successfully.

```yml
name: Tutorial - run_when_succeeded - 1
description: Workflow control

interfaces:
  tutorial/workflow-run-when-succeeded-1:
    output: http
    method: POST

    actions:
      - name: CheckLoginBody
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: email
              is_not_null: true

     - name: CheckParams
        input: a|params
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true

      - name: RunOnSuccess
        run_when_succeeded:
          - CheckLoginBody # run this action if these have passed
          - CheckParams
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true
```

## run_when_failed

Run this action when the list of defined actions under `run_when_failed` has failed.

```yml
name: Tutorial - run_when_failed - 1
description: Workflow control

interfaces:
  tutorial/workflow-run-when-failed-1:
    output: http
    method: POST

    actions:
      - name: CheckLoginBody
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: email
              is_not_null: true

     - name: CheckParams
        input: a|params
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true

      - name: RunOnFailure
        run_when_failed:
          - CheckLoginBody # run this action if these two have failed
          - CheckParams
        input: a|body
        assert:
          tests:
            - value: something
              is_not_null: true
```
