# 01 - Connecting

You can define your database parameters inline with your action.

However the recommended place to define your database is in the **globals** section.
 - This will enable you to reuse connections where possible over different configuration files
 - If you are running in self-hosted mode ensure you do not have different database connections using the same identifier
    - eg. do **not** have multiple **different** connections defined as **main** or other
    - if they are the same connection then it is okay to have the same name
 - You can also supply your connection string via environment variables, a secrets system, or even use our managed variables and secrets system


## Connecting with a connection string

```yaml title="global mongodb connection"
name: mongodb-find-example
version: 0.0.1

global:
  databases:
    main: 
      driver: mongodb
      conn_string: |
        mongodb+srv://someUser:somePass@bob-perf.hello.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=my-test
```
