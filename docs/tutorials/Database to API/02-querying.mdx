# 02 - Querying

To begin we will create a simple HTTP GET route to query a postgres database for the top 10 orders.

Following we will then:
- Enhance it by utilizing input parameters to dynamically adjust the query via query parameters and the body payload
- Validate the input parameters before executing the query

### Simple example
```yaml title="querying your database"
name: GetTopOrders
description: perform postgres query to get the top orders from the database

global:
  databases:
    main:
      driver: postgres
      conn_string: |
        postgresql://my_pg_user:my_pg_pass@200.100.50.9:5432?connect_timeout=10"

interfaces:
  tutorial/top-orders:
    output: http

    actions:
      - name: FetchTopOrders
        database: main
        query: SELECT order_id, customer_name, order_date, total_amount, status FROM orders ORDER BY total_amount DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Dynamic with input parameters

Now we will extend the previous example to use input parameters from query parameters, we can also do this via data in a payload body.

You can also do this from chaining on from data contained in a previous action.

### From query parameters

Assuming your API endpoint has the following structure with a `?customer=bob` query parameter.

Eg. 
- https://api.airpipe.io/your-org-uuid/staging/tutorial/top-orders?customer=bob
- http://0.0.0.0:4111/tutorial/top-orders?customer=bob

We can dynamically use the customer value in the query parameter and pass it to our query.

```yaml title="querying your database using query parameters"
name: GetTopOrders
description: perform postgres query to get the top orders from the database

global:
  databases:
    main:
      driver: postgres
      conn_string: |
        postgresql://my_pg_user:my_pg_pass@200.100.50.9:5432?connect_timeout=10"

interfaces:
  tutorial/top-orders:
    output: http

    actions:
      - name: FetchTopOrders
        database: main
        # updated query to have a where clause on customer_name using $1  
        query: SELECT order_id, customer_name, order_date, total_amount, status FROM orders WHERE customer_name LIKE $1 ORDER BY total_amount DESC LIMIT 10;
        params: [ a|params::customer| ] # passing the value `customer` from the query parameters
```

### From body payload

Assuming your API endpoint has the following structure, we can send a post payload with for eg.

```json
{
  "customer": "bob"
}
```

Eg. 
- https://api.airpipe.io/your-org-uuid/staging/tutorial/top-orders
- http://0.0.0.0:4111/tutorial/top-orders

We can dynamically use the customer value in the body and pass it to our query.

```yaml title="querying your database using body payload"
name: GetTopOrders
description: perform postgres query to get the top orders from the database

global:
  databases:
    main:
      driver: postgres
      conn_string: |
        postgresql://my_pg_user:my_pg_pass@200.100.50.9:5432?connect_timeout=10"

interfaces:
  tutorial/top-orders:
    output: http
    method: POST # <-- method updated to POST

    actions:
      - name: FetchTopOrders
        database: main
        # updated query to have a where clause on customer_name using $1  
        query: SELECT order_id, customer_name, order_date, total_amount, status FROM orders WHERE customer_name LIKE $1 ORDER BY total_amount DESC LIMIT 10;
        params: [ a|body::customer| ] # passing the value `customer` from the body payload
```

### Validating inputs and using previous action data

In typical scenarios you want to validate your input data before proceeding.

You can use the [assertion](/docs/configuration/interfaces/actions/asserts) system to validate prior actions, and then also use special keywords to prevent the next actions from executing conditionally.


```yaml title="querying your database using body payload with validation"
name: GetTopOrders
description: perform postgres query to get the top orders from the database

global:
  databases:
    main:
      driver: postgres
      conn_string: |
        postgresql://my_pg_user:my_pg_pass@200.100.50.9:5432?connect_timeout=10"

interfaces:
  tutorial/top-orders:
    output: http
    method: POST # <-- method updated to POST

    actions:
      - name: InputBody
        input: a|body
        assert:  # use the assert/test system to validate the payload
          tests:
            - value: customer # target the customer attribute from a|body payload
              is_not_null: true # ensure it exists
              is_greater_than: 2
              is_less_than: 20

      - name: FetchTopOrders
        run_when_succeeded:
          - InputBody # prevent this action from running unless this succeeds (you can also use `previous` as a shortcut to refer to the prior action)
        database: main
        # updated query to have a where clause on customer_name using $1 positional parameter
        query: SELECT order_id, customer_name, order_date, total_amount, status FROM orders WHERE customer_name LIKE $1 ORDER BY total_amount DESC LIMIT 10;
        params: [ a|InputBody::customer| ] # passing the `customer` value from the previous action (InputBody) to $1 
```
