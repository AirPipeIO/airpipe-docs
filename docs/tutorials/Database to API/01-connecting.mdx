# 01 - Connecting

You can define your database parameters inline with your action.

However the recommended place to define your database is in the **globals** section.
 - This will enable you to reuse connections where possible over different configuration files
 - If you are running in self-hosted mode ensure you do not have different database connections using the same identifier
    - eg. do **not** have multiple **different** connections defined as **main** or other
    - if they are the same connection then it is okay to have the same name
 - You can also supply your connection string via environment variables, a secrets system, or even use our managed variables and secrets system

You can connect with two formats depending on your usecase, [`conn_string`](#connecting-with-a-connection-string) or defining the connection parameters. 

Sometimes due to complex passwords and particular characters the connection string may become invalid or require escaping.
To overcome this it is best to use the [explicit parameters](#connecting-with-parameters).


## Connecting with a connection string

```yaml title="global postgres connection"
name: postgres
description: example pg connection

global:
  databases:
    main: # identifier to use with each action
      driver: postgres
      conn_string: |
        postgresql://my_pg_user:my_pg_pass@200.100.50.9:5432?connect_timeout=10"
```

## Connecting with parameters
```yaml title="global postgres connection"
name: postgres_example
description: example pg connection

global:
  databases:
    main: # identifier to use with each action
      driver: postgres
      user: my_pg_user
      pass: my_password
      host: "200.100.50.9"
      port: "5432"
```
