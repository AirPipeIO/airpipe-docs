# 00 - Setup

The `airpipe` binary and hosted mode offering allow you to connect and query your own databases.

Currently `postgres` is supported, with more to follow.

Note: When you are running it yourself in self hosted mode your connections will be persisted for performance.

### Requirements
- Available database
- Ensure the database is reachable
