# 00 - Setup

The `airpipe` binary and hosted mode offering allow you to connect and query your own databases.


This tutorial is targeted towards relational based databases such as postgres and not NoSQL/Document Stores.

Currently supported databases ***(more coming soon!)***:

Note: When you are running it yourself in self hosted mode your connections will be persisted for performance.

### Requirements
